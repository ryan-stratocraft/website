        <p>
          Strato-Craft is a digital product company focused on building applications that make life 
          easier, more accessible, and more human‚Äîthrough AI. We develop innovative tools that help 
          people understand, connect, and interact with the world in new ways.

        <p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Strato-Craft was founded with a personal purpose: to use technology, especially AI, to support 
          <strong> neurodivergent individuals</strong> like myself in navigating challenges in learning, 
          communication, dating, and day-to-day living.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe technology should adapt to people, not the other way around.

        <p>
          At our core, we're not a consultancy or a service provider. <strong>We're builders</strong>‚Äîcreating 
          useful, empathetic, and empowering apps. Our products are tools designed to help people experience 
          the world on their own terms.

        <p>
          We believe in collaboration and responsiveness. If you have an idea or a real-life problem you 
          want solved through tech, <strong>reach out</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we build something based on your idea, we'll recognize you publicly as a contributor and 
          offer a small stake in the app (subject to terms and conditions). We don't charge people for 
          sharing ideas‚Äîthey're what move us forward.
