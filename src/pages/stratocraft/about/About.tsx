      <p className="strato-about-intro">
        Strato-Craft is a digital product company focused on building applications that make life easier, more accessible, and more human—through AI.
      </p>

      <p className="strato-about-intro">
        Our mission is to develop innovative tools that help people understand, connect, and interact with the world in new ways. We don’t build for profit margins or trends—we build with real people in mind. Strato-Craft was founded with a personal purpose: to use technology, especially AI, to support neurodivergent individuals like myself in navigating challenges in learning, communication, dating, and day-to-day living.
      </p>

      <p className="strato-about-text">
        <strong>Oh-i</strong> Our first product,  is a personality- and place-based dating app that reimagines how people match and connect. It’s just the beginning. 
        </p>

        <p className="strato-about-text">
        <strong>IAC VR</strong> We’re also working on our flagship project, a visual Infrastructure-as-Code platform designed to help people interact with complex systems in intuitive ways—especially for those who learn best by seeing and doing.
      

      </p>

      <p className="strato-about-intro">
        At our core, we’re not a consultancy or a service provider. We’re builders—creating useful, empathetic, and empowering apps. Our products are tools designed to help people experience the world on their own terms.
      </p>

      

      <p className="strato-about-intro">
        We believe in collaboration and responsiveness. If you have an idea or a real-life problem you want solved through tech, reach out. If we build something based on your idea, we’ll recognize you publicly as a contributor and offer a small stake in the app (subject to terms and conditions). We don’t charge people for sharing ideas—they’re what move us forward.
      </p>

      <p className="strato-about-intro">
        Strato-Craft is here for the curious, the different, the creative, and the visionary. We’re building apps for people who want the world to make a bit more sense—and maybe even be more fun.
